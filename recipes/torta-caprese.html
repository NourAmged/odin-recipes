            <li><em>10 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</em></li>
            <li><em>1 cup ground almond meal (also know as almond flour)</em></li>
            <li><em>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</em></li>
            <li><em>1 tablespoon coffee liqueur</em></li>
            <li><em>½ teaspoon kosher salt</em></li>
            <li><em>tiny pinch cayenne pepper (Optional)</em></li>
            <li><em>4 large eggs, at room temperature</em></li>
            <li><em>¾ cup white granulated sugar</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease<br>
                an 8-inch cake pan with butter, and place a round piece of parchment<br>
                paper in the bottom. Dust the inside and sides with flour and knock out<br>
                access. Set aside.</em></li>
            <br>
            <li><em>Place chocolate and butter in a mixing bowl, and place on top of a<br>
                saucepan filled with 1 inch of water. Place on low heat until the butter<br>
                and chocolate have melted.
                </em></li>
            <br>
            <li><em>Remove from heat, and stir together with a spatula. Stir in almond<br>
                meal, cocoa powder, coffee liqueur, salt, and cayenne until fully<br>
                combined. Set aside.</em></li>
            <br>
            <li><em>Combine eggs and sugar in a second bowl, and beat with an electric<br>
                mixer, or whisk by hand until very thick and pale colored.</em></li>
            <br>
            <li><em>Pour chocolate mixture into the egg mixture; fold in gently with a<br>
                spatula until just combined. Transfer batter into the prepared pan.<br>
                Tap pan on the counter to settle the mixture.</em></li>
            <br>
            <li><em>Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden skewer inserted near the<br>
                 center comes out almost clean, 25 to 30 minutes.</em></li>
            <br>
            <li><em>Let cool for 30 minutes in the pan before turning out onto a plate.<br>
                 Let cool to room temperature, before wrapping and transferring into the<br> 
                 fridge to chill before serving.</em></li>
            <br>
            <li><em>Before cutting, the top can be dusted with cocoa and/or powdered<br>
                 sugar if desired. Serve with unsweetened whipped cream and fresh<br> 
                 raspberries.</em></li>
